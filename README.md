# tone-recorder
Python script to generate and record patterns of sine-wave frequencies

## Prerequisites

Install required python packages

```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Configuring the patterns is _extremely_ manual, and can be done directly in the `main.py` file.

## Running

To run the script, play the audio, and save the appropriate .wav files, modify the `main.py` file to play the frequencies and durations and run 

```Shell
python main.py
```
